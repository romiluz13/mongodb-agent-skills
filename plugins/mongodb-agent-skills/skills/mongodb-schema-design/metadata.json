  "abstract": "MongoDB schema design patterns and anti-patterns for AI agents and developers. Contains 30 rules across 5 categories: Schema Anti-Patterns (CRITICAL - unbounded arrays, bloated documents, schema drift), Schema Fundamentals (HIGH - embed vs reference, document model, 16MB awareness), Relationship Patterns (HIGH - one-to-one, one-to-few, one-to-many, one-to-squillions, many-to-many, tree structures), Design Patterns (MEDIUM - bucket, time series collections, attribute, polymorphic, schema versioning, computed, subset, outlier, extended reference), and Schema Validation (MEDIUM - JSON Schema, validation levels, rollout strategy). Each rule includes incorrect/correct code examples with quantified impact metrics, 'When NOT to use' exceptions, and verification diagnostics.",
