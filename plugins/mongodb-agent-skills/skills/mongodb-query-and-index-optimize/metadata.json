  "abstract": "MongoDB query optimization and indexing strategies for AI agents and developers. Contains 30 rules across 5 categories: Index Essentials (CRITICAL - ESR rule, compound field order, covered queries, prefix principle, index sizing), Specialized Indexes (HIGH - partial, sparse, TTL, text search, wildcard, multikey, geospatial), Query Patterns (HIGH - projections, avoiding $ne/$nin, anchored regex, batching, pagination, $exists behavior), Aggregation Optimization (HIGH - $match/$project early, $sort+$limit coalescence, $lookup indexing, $unwind control, allowDiskUse), and Performance Diagnostics (MEDIUM - explain() interpretation, slow query profiler, $indexStats analysis). Each rule includes incorrect/correct code examples with quantified impact metrics, 'When NOT to use' exceptions, and verification diagnostics.",
