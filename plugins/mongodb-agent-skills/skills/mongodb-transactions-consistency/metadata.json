  "abstract": "MongoDB transaction correctness and consistency guidance for AI agents and developers. Contains 20 rules across 5 categories: Transaction Fundamentals (CRITICAL), Consistency Semantics (HIGH), Retry and Error Handling (CRITICAL), Operational Constraints (HIGH), and Implementation Patterns (MEDIUM). Covers ACID guarantees, session propagation, readConcern/writeConcern trade-offs, causal consistency, commit uncertainty, transient retries, transaction runtime and lock limits, sharded transaction caveats, and idempotent application patterns. This skill avoids overlap with schema and query/index performance skills by focusing on multi-document correctness and failure-safe execution.",
